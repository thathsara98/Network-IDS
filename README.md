# Network-IDS
Network Intrusion Detection system using Python and Machine Learning
This notebook demonstrates the process of building a robust intrusion detector with an undelying assumption that intrusions are different types of anomalies which occur rarely and when they do occur, their signature is quite different from that of normal instances.

Whenever an intrusion/anomaly is present, it is mostly visible in one or more features in the collected time-series data. The values of a single feature or combination of features significantly deviate from the rest of the values when everything was normal. Said differently, we can observe a difference in data distribution when an attack/intrusion occurs.
